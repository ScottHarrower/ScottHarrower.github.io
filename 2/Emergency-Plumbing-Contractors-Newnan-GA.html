<p>Mechanical water softening units are therefore also called ion exchange water softeners. The best way to clear a clogged drain without damaging your pipes and plumbing system is to contact a relied on local plumber at ABC.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
