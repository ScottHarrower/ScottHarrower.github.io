<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
