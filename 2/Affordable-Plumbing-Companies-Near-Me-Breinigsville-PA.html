<p>IRWD is dedicated to providing safe, high quality water to consumers. Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our clients is kept free from harmful contaminants. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment containing a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection.
