<p>The average life expectancy of an electrical hot water heater is more than that of a gas one. Hidden sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain pathway, small pipes range from the tub and sink to ultimately meet up with a bigger one beneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the house.</p>
<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't set up correctly, you may experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>
