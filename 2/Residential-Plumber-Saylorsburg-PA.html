<p>A garbage disposal should not leak. When this takes place, it typically suggests wear and tear which is a fair indication that its time is up. If you consider what you put down the disposal, leakages can be unhygienic and will likewise ultimately cause pressure on other parts of your waste disposal unit.

It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
