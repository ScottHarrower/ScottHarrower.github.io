<p>When the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its performance below the developed minimum basic, backflow preventers should only be fixed. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer.

These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
