<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to service? The timing of regeneration depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, despite whether the water really requires it. When required, newer systems utilize digital sensing units that keep an eye on bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water use and therefore just restore. These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
