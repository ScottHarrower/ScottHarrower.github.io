<p>Irrigation backflow gadgets are designed for installation on drinkable water lines to protect versus both back-siphonage and back-pressure of infected water into the safe and clean supply of water. We're your local sink plumber with experience and knowledge in repairs, drain cleaning, undermount sink installation, kitchen sink installation, and bathroom sink installation. Don't let toilet problems get you down! Call Stewart Plumbing today to learn whether your toilet could benefit from a repair or replacement. The City of Jacksonville Structure Inspection Division has required the installation of backflow preventers on all commercial fire sprinkler service lines, watering lines and potable water lines. Commercial assemblies should be evaluated every year.</p>
<p>Back-siphonage is backflow brought on by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. The effect is similar to drinking water through a straw. Back-siphonage can happen when there is an interruption of water supply due to nearby fire fighting, a break in a water main, and so on</p>
