Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can attain this.</p>
