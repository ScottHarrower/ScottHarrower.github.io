<p>Water softeners leaks are primarily triggered since of a problem at the point of installation or due to the fact that of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced in time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is likely broken and just needs to be replaced if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
