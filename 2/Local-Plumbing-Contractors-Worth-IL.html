<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health risk if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, along with inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
