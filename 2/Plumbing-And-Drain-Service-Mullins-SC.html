<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not come with a power cord connected. Eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1) if this is the case. Make sure to purchase a circuitry package with the correct power score and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Make sure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord when you connect the wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
<p>As soon as the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
