<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the drinkable system providing the make-up water. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Potential contaminants can then get in the drinkable water supply. The very best way to lower build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly difficult with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
