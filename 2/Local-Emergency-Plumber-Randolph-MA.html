<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Randolph MA</h3>
<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are many elements that accelerate rust in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of rust control. Therefore, considering all these aspects, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
