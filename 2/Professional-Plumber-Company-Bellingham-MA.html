<p>PEX fulfills building code nearly all over, comes with a 25-year service warranty, and puts a smaller sized hit on your budget than copper. Changing all of the plumbing in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home with copper piping expenses in between $8,000 and $10,000. Many pipe concerns can be repaired with a basic repair. Patching is often enough for one-off problems and small leakages. However, if you experience any of the following problems in your home, you need to think about repiping.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
