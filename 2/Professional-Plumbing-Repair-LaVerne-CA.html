<p>Daily use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the system in a steady and safe area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait until after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also inspect to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

Call your insurance coverage representative and confirm your protection. Once you have checked out your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered, check with your representative to confirm that your understanding is proper.</p>
