<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an unexpected decrease in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire fighting or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can create a suction result and draw potential pollutants into the potable (drinking) water system. Tank water heaters are frequently discovered in the majority of houses. Their elements are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's required. A pipe emerges from the leading to provide warm water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
