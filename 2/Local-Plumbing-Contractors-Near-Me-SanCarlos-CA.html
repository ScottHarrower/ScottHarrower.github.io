<p>Tankless hot water heater are likewise fueled by gas or electrical power, however they do not save water within the system. They are compact and just heat water as needed, making them more environmentally friendly. Tankless water heaters typically require a greater initial investment, but they are less costly to run and provide additional benefits like endless warm water.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
