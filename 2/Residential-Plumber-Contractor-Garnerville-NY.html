<p>Great deals of bad things are being stated on this short article about liners. I find that numerous old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no clue on what they are stating.

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
