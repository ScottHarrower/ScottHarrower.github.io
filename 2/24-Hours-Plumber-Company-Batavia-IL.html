<p>Inadequately set up gas lines cause gas leaks. Gas leaks are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy task. The gas lines need to be adjusted to the ideal levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the second greatest energy consuming area of a house, beside cooling and heating. The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
<p>Another way to handle a clog is by using a chemical cleaning product or if you fear they might be too severe on your pipes, you can try old home remedies like hot water, vinegar, and baking soda.
