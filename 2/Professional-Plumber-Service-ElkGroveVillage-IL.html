<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
