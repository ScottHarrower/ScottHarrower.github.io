<p>Usually, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or in between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber.

<p>If you see rust just in your hot water, then check the status of your water heater's anode rod. You may need a professional to do this if you've never ever done this on your own. The rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. If this is the case, replace your water heater as quickly as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you most likely have actually worn away piping.</p>
