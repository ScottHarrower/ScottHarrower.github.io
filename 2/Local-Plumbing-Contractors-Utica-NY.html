<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Utica NY</h3>
<p>Water softeners leaks are mostly triggered because of a problem at the point of installation or since of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is cracked, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal might likewise be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration procedures. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely cracked and merely needs to be replaced.</p>
