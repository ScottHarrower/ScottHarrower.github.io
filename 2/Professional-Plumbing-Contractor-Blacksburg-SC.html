<h3>Water Softener Repair in Blacksburg South Carolina</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least three attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the freshly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the task was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
