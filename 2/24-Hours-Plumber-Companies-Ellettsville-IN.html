<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can acquire models with special features that do everything but add the salt, you will spend for each extra feature. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm guarantee that the unique feature will not fail. Depending upon the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you must think about the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regrowth cycle. This might or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
<p>Use the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it totally free. Several houses in my area being repiped and have actually talked to neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't detected soon, apparently it starts with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can trigger major damage.</p>
