<p>Surprise water leakages are typically demanding and have Possibly Severe Repercussions. Changing your flapper may need slightly different actions than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however chances are you'll locate one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
