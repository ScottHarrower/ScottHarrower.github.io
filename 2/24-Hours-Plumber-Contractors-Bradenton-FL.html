<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, in addition to inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
