<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The fundamental ways of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow.

<p>If you're like many people, you've never even thought about it, but flushing your water heater can help it last longer and could conserve you cash on energy costs by bring back the efficiency of the water heater. Your water heater should be flushed once a year. If you have a 15‐year‐old hot water heater that's never been flushed, it may have up to 8 inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank. That means eight fewer inches of hot water, not to mention the reality that your tap water is being warmed in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling bacteria.</p>
