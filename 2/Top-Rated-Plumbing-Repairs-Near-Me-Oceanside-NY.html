<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening simply removes firmness minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
