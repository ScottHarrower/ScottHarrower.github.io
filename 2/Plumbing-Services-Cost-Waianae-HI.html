<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health risk conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only secure against back siphonage.</p>
