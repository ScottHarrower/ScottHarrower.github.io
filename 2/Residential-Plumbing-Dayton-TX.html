<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
