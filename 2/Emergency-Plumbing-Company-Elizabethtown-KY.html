<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mostly time related. If whatever is all set, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours needed and therefore the overall costs. Most plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
