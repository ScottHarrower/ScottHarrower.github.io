<p>We had a fantastic experience with Joe Boyette, he was really professional, polite, competent. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month duration. We also had to replace a water and a bathroom heater unrelated to the fire, however we felt great in Joe's capabilities. We decided to stick with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter costs were certainly on the high-end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

That is why we offer a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a color test.</p>

A recent sewage-disposal tank research study from the Water Quality Association clearly suggests that there are no negative impacts when water softening waste water is released into effectively installed private septic tanks. There are several additional reports that also discuss further evidence of the solidity ions in a softener's regeneration waste causing less clogging and preserving greater permeability than the routine septic system effluent.</p>
