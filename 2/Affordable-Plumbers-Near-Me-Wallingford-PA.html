<p>Most plumbers will get rid of the old system to install the brand-new one at the same per hour rate. This can increase the amount of time needed to install the new system, therefore increasing costs. This truly depends on what condition the rest of the pipes remain in, and how hard the old system is to get rid of. In a lot of cases, elimination will only include an additional $25 to $50 to the total expenses, however in some cases the expenses might be greater if additional pipes need to also be changed.</p>
