<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Brooklyn MD</h3>
<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hold on to favorable ions. The fresh media starts by hanging on to the weaker charged salt ions. As hard water passes through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Because the hardness minerals have a higher positive charge than the salt, they will knock the salt ions off and take their location.</p>
<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of worn thin pipe and the painting the within the used pipe with epoxy paint. In some cases throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. A few of those thin spots leak right away and sometimes those leakages come weeks or days later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be correctly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
