I 'd like to post some images of this. Simply search line. The issue does exist.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical compound that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water rather than developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they stay in one place for long, as they may in a water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>
