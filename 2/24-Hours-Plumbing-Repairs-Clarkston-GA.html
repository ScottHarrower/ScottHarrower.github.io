<p>Understand that softened water includes trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water contains about the very same amount of salt as a slice of bread. That's not very much salt, but for those on a strict sodium-free diet plan it might be excessive. If this does not work, you may need to replace among your toilet's components, generally the flapper. There might also be an issue with the chain connected to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can easily replace these parts.</p>
<h3>Shower Valve Replacement in Clarkston Georgia</h2>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>
