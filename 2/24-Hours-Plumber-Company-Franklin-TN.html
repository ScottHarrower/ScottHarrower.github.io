Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
