But, the high-energy cost savings will more than recover this expenditure over the next few years. To get your garbage disposal working again, you will initially want to use a flashlight to check for foreign things lodged in the drum's openings. You can eliminate it securely with needle-nose pliers if you observe an obstruction.</p>
