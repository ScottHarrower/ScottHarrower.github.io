<p>When you need a water heater replacement, there are a number of things that you need to consider to help you choose.

Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
<p>A new water heater will likely last longer, provide you fewer problems, and cost you less to operate with time.

Follow the directions that include the units. Backflow preventers should be inspected annual for correct operation. In areas where it freezes, the backflow preventer must be protected from freezing. See the Irrigation System Winterization tutorial for details.</p>
