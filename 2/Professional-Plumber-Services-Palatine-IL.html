<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Palatine IL</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be continuously monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
