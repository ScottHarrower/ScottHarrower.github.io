<p>Steamfitters and pipefitters, sometimes simply called fitters, install and maintain pipes that might carry gases, acids, and chemicals. These pipes are primarily in manufacturing, commercial, and commercial settings. Fitters repair and install pipe systems in power plants, along with heating and cooling systems in big office buildings. Steamfitters concentrate on systems that are created for the circulation of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters might specialize as sprinklerfitters or gasfitters.</p>
<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
