Consult your water softener dealership for info on resin replacement.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers need to only be repaired when the data gathered from the field test shows the assembly has deteriorated in its performance below the established minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if essential, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
