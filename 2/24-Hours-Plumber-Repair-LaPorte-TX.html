<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
