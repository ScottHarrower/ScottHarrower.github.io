<p>The next action we need to perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to guarantee the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
