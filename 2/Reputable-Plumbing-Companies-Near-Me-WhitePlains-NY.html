<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the perpetrator. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
