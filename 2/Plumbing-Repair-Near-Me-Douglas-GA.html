<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the best is common in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
