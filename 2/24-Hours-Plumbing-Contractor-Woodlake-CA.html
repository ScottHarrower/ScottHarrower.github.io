<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>In general, toilets are pretty basic to repair and operate. Almost any part can be removed and replaced reasonably quickly and rapidly The flipside of the toilet's low maintenance nature is, when it has an issue, the stakes are high. Harmed toilets can do some truly extensive, costly, and ... stinky damage to a house. When something fails, and your kitchen sink starts backing up, your toilet will not flush, or you can't shower, you need for professional support right away. That's where High 5 Plumbing can be found in. With years of market experience, we understand how to deal with a wide range of drain problems.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
