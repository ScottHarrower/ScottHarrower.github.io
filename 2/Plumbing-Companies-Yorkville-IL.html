<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market.
