The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage just for non-health threat or health hazard conditions. They should be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just secure against back siphonage.</p>

If an air space is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is required.
