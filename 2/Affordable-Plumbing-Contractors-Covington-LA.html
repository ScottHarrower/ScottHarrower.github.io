These 2 pieces have complementary grooves that when correctly fitted together hold the mount ring and disposal in location. Holding the mount ring at the upper part of the flange, work the cushion install over the bottom of the flange, making sure that the rubber of the cushion mount is totally and securely locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When set up correctly, you need to not be able to remove the cushion install without significant pulling and extending, and the mount ring needs to turn freely around it.</p>
