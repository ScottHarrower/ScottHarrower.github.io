<p>Handheld sprayer. Leaks can often develop on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are connected to the kitchen sink. Water will drip into the cabinet beneath if the leak is far enough down the water line.

<p>Solar water heaters: These ecologically friendly and affordable heaters draw energy from the sun to heat water. They need no electrical energy or gas and can lower your bills by an estimated 14 to 18%.
