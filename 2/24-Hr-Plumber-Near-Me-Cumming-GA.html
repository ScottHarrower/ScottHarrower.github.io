<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping).

The majority of houses in the US, consisting of Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets also have a flapper seal made from rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank until the toilet is flushed.

<p>We use quality products. In many circumstances, we attempt to utilize versatile carbon steel to transfer natural gas from the outside gas source to home appliances. Versatile steel removes the need to cut and piece individual sections of piping together which minimizes potential for gas leakages. Carbon steel has additives that can hold up against specific conditions during component direct exposure. Tracer wire is frequently utilized with versatile carbon steel to alert the gas company when a leak takes place. We can guarantee that these lines are working correctly.</p>
