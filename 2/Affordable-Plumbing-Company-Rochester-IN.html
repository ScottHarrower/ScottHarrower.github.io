Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet.
