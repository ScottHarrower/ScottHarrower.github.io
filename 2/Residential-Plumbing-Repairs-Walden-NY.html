<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Walden NY</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies need to be evaluated by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure appropriate backflow prevention is in place to protect our drinking water throughout the watering season. Denver Water will send out a testing pointer notice thirty days prior to the annual test is due.</p>
