<p>After showing up after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but claimed they would not take duty if it leaked now due to the fact that of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was assembled. After they gave me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, since I never want to see this company again.</p>
<p>Utilize the useful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it totally free.
