<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually supported into the downstairs bathroom sink.

If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside. An RPZ will periodically release percentages of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow sufficient drainage.</p>

It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
