When working with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which helps use extra pressure to the clog. For obstructions that take place even more down the pipe, utilize a cable auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made from long, flexible steel cable television wound around a spindle with a hand crank. To utilize a cable auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap beneath the sink, making sure it is not clogged prior to proceeding. Take out 18 inches of cable at a time, crank the handle in a clockwise direction and press the auger forward at the exact same time.
