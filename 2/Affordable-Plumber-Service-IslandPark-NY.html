<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller sized design that operated on the same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
