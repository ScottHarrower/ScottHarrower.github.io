<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Calimesa CA</h3>
<p>If a cable television has not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the new disposer any time ahead of time, joining the cable television to the wires in package prior to or just after installing the disposer. Garbage disposals are quite easy to maintain. The most essential thing to remember is that they are truly food disposals. Items that would otherwise go in the garbage should not be put in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything flammable, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>If you see rust just in your warm water, then inspect the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. If you have actually never done this on your own, you might need a professional to do this. The rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. If this is the case, replace your water heater as quickly as possible.
