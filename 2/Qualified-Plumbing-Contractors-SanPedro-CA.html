<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can position problems.</p>
