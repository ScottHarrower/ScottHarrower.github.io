The very best one for you depends on just how much hot water you use, and the heating approach (electricity, gas, oil).

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
