<h3>Plumbing Services Around Fulton NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
