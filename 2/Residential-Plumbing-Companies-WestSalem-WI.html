<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a few things worth knowing about garbage disposal installation.

<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, maybe less important things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
