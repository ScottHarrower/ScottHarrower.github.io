<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
