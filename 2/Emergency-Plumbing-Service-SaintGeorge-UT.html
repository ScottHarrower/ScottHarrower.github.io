Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.

<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these problems.</p>

<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
