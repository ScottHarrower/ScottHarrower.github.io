<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Troutdale OR!</h3>

By having the anode rod inspected routinely and changed as needed, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
