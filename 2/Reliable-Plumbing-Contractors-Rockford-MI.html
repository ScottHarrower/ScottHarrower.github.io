<p>Many homes or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the external coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>At least once every 3 months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder performance, and draining a gallon or so assists eliminate the sediment. If you identify a leak and choose a patching task instead of a repiping task, just remember that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the same material and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to consider repiping your whole house when you find a leak.</p>
