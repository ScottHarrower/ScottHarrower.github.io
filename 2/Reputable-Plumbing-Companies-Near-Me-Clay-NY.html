<p>Read your insurance coverage policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have actually stopped working. Make sure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be rejected because the standard HO-3 homeowners' policy specifically omits "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over an extended amount of time." Call your insurance coverage agent and validate your protection. When you have read through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered, check with your representative to verify that your understanding is proper.</p>
<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most destructive and prevalent water problems: hard water.  Tough water ruined the modern house. Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale considerably shortens the life expectancy of home appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice machines. Hard water damages hot water home appliances. The higher the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and solidify into solid deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
