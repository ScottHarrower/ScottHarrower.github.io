<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its numerous intended usages around your home.</p>
<p>Plumbing is the practice, materials and components used in the installation, maintenance, extension, and change of all piping, components, plumbing home appliances, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with sanitary drainage or storm drainage facilities; venting systems and public or private water supply systems, within or surrounding to any building or structure.</p>
<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board recommends the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections relating to the administration of Article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage takes place when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a personal water supply into the general public water supply.
