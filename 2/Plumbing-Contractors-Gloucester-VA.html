<p>In many cases, the toilet can be fixed rather than changed, since the concern frequently comes down to a single component or 2. In some cases, however, the damage is so extensive that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is simply a more useful alternative. This normally includes cracks in the toilet bowl itself, extensive deterioration over several components, or simply since you 'd like to replace your existing toilet with something more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Really frequently the circular blade inside is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Simply place a long, tough, wooden handle (a broom deal with will suffice) into the opening.

Find the reset switch on the bottom of the system if so. Use any type of drain cleaner to free it if the clog continues.</p>
