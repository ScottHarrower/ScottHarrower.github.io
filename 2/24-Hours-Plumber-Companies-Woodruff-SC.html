<p>Water solidity is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term solidity" originated from ... it's hard to wash in.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can purchase designs with unique features that do whatever however add the salt, you will pay for each extra feature. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm guarantee that the special feature will not fail. Depending upon the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit. Lastly, if you own a septic system, you must think about the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This may or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause difficulty too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
