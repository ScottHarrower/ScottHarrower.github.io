<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and somewhere else during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
