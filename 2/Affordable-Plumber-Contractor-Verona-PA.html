<p>In many cases, our professionals will advise that you replace your water heater rather than purchase repairs. This is typically When the water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would amount to more than half the cost of a whole brand-new system, the case. In some cases a problematic toilet simply needs a minor change and life is back to regular. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a color test.</p>

Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the accumulation could still happen.</p>

For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
