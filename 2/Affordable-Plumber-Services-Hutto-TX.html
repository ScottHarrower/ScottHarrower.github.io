<p>Many plumbers will eliminate the old system to install the brand-new one at the exact same hourly rate. This can increase the amount of time needed to install the new system, therefore increasing costs. This really depends on what condition the remainder of the pipes remain in, and how tough the old unit is to remove. Oftentimes, elimination will just include an extra $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, however in some cases the expenses could be higher if additional pipes should also be replaced.</p>
