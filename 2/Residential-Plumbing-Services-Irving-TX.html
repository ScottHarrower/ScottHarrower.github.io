<p>The law also requires annual testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report sent to the DEP. Failure to comply can cause penalties and termination of water service. Since backflow preventer devices are made up of moving parts, seals, and springs and are subject to corrosive compounds, wear, and tiredness, it's important to properly keep them to ensure they properly operate and play their part in keeping our city's drinking water safe.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most apparent signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your home. Even if the issue originates with the community system, it's still smart to generate the professionals to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
