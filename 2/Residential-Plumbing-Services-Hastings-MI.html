<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Hastings MI</h3>

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
