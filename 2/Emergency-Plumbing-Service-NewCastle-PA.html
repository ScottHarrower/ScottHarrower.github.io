<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or broken, it could wreak unwelcome concerns on your property.

<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
