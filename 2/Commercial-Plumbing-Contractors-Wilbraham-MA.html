<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by attaching a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank need to be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might supply a fast fix in the short term, it can trigger even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. A great place to begin looking for the leaking kitchen sink plumbing system is underneath the puddle of water or where you seem to feel the moisture most.</p>

I didn't even bother to try calling them back, given that I never want to see this company once again.</p>
