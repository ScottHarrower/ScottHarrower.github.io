<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
