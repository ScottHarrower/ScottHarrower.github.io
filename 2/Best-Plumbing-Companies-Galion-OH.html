It's prevalent for a toilet to have actually worn out parts at some time which triggers the toilet to run. When somebody states a toilet is running, what they suggest is the toilet will not stop running. This is typically due to worn out flapper valve, but a couple of other common problems are the fill valve and the overflow tube.</p>
<p>After arriving after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take duty if it leaked now because of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, considering that I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
