<p>When the information gathered from the field test shows the assembly has degraded in its performance listed below the established minimum basic, backflow preventers need to only be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if necessary, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>

<p>Liners are another popular product sewer cleaners sell these days. A liner is a fabric tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin.
