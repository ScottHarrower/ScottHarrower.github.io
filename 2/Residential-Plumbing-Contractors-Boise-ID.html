<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of 3 efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink.

Fire protection system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be very various, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation requires to be developed and set up to satisfy that particular hazard or need.
