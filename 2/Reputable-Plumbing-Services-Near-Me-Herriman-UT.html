<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the very first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. An RPBA works versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be used to isolate health or non-health dangers.</p>
