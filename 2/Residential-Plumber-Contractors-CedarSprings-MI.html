<p>A minimum of once every three months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct performance, and draining a gallon or two helps eliminate the sediment. If you spot a leak and select a patching task rather of a repiping task, simply remember that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the very same material and they might be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your entire house when you spot a leak.</p>
