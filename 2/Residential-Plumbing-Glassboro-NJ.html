<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
