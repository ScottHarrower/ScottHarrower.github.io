Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
