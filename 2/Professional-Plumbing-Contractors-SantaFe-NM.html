<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
