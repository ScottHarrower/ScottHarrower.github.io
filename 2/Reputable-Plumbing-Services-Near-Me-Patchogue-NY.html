<p>Hidden water leakages are typically demanding and have Possibly Severe Effects. Changing your flapper may require slightly various steps than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but chances are you'll find among the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

<p>New homes constructed with copper pipes are especially prone to destructive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become coated inside. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a duration of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
