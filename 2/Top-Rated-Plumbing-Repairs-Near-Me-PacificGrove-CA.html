When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
