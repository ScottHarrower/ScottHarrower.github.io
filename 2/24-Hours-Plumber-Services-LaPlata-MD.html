<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
