After we have cleaned up the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be difficult, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to assure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
<p>The simplest way to keep you and your household safe from the potential risks of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the very first place. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water function or other type of cross connection, have actually an approved backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
