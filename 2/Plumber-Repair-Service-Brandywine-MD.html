That's not quite salt, but for those on a stringent sodium-free diet it might be too much. If this does not work, you may need to replace among your toilet's elements, normally the flapper. There might also be a concern with the chain attached to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can easily replace these parts.</p>

<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
