<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular incident, however it does occur regularly than you think! When you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
