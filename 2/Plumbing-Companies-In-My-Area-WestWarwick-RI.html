Water pressure may fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP garbage disposal system can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is very little insulation in the weaker designs.
