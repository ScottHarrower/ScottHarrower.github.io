Fire protection system are created to match the threat that exists in the places they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be very different, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be developed and installed to satisfy that particular danger or need. An aircraft garage will need a very various fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would also vary greatly.</p>
