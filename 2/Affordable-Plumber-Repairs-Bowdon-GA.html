<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
