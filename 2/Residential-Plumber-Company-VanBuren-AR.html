<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That slow, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water discolorations and corrosion. However don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
