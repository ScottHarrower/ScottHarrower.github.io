<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
