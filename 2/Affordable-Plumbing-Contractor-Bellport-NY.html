<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Bellport NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems.

Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
