Aluminum disposals are the most economical, costing about $70 to $150 a pop but are vulnerable to corrosion and leaking.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The standard means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
