<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided superb service for us in replacing an extremely balky tub spout, and worn toilet parts. Not only was he incredibly professional and extensive however he had the ability to answer all my questions concerning the service. I would offer 6 stars if I could. A camera inspection of your sewer line is among the most reliable ways of locating the specific whereabouts of a plumbing problem. A plumber will place a specifically designed waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live video footage to identify where and what the source of the problem is.</p>

<h3>Shower Repairs in Bakersfield CA - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>To repair and replace a gas line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Fixing a gas line is actually changing a gas line - if it's faulty it needs to be replaced. The cost of gas line replacement is figured out by the cost of labor and products. The difference of the cost depends upon whether the project is a basic gas leak repair or a full replacement of the gas line system. Additional gas line installation for brand-new home appliances are charged independently.</p>
<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer will be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on wet or dry lawn sprinkler unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
<p>Sometimes, your faucet can be the one triggering sink issues. If you have a leaky faucet, an irregular water stream, faucet knobs that squeak, screeching or clanking sounds when you turn the faucet on, or a faucet that's simply old and does not function well, our commercial and residential sink repair services can assist. Whether it's your kitchen sink, bathroom sink, or a sink in your laundry room, we'll examine the issue and find an option.</p>
<p>It can easily become a plumbing emergency for your home if a clogged drain is left untreated. At Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning we provide 24-hour emergency assistance for situations like burst pipes brought on by clogs. Detach the waste disposal unit, if you're waiting. How the disposal is connected to the sink differs based on brand and type. Describe your product instructions or get in touch with the maker if you need guidance. The disposal will generally be connected to the drain line with either a nut or a screw.</p>
