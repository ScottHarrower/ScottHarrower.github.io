<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due largely to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment.

The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
