<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Chatham IL</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
