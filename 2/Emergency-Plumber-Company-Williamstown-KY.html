<p>There are numerous things that you need to consider to help you choose when you need a water heater replacement. A great general general rule is that when your present water heater reaches its 10th birthday, you should start preparing for a replacement.

<p>For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can cause rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. However, if they remain in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>

<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.
