Based upon research conducted by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Benefits Research Study, 2011.</p>
<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General. Within the structure envelope consisting of listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a sub-system, system, or fixture  group is changed, an authorization and inspection will not be needed.
