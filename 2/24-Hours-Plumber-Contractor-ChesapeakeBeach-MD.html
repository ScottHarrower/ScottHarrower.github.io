<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your safety, benefit, convenience, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is very crucial! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Present guidelines restrict the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines.
