Knowing if you have galvanized water pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be helpful when negotiating the sale of a house. There are so many types of piping systems and conditions, it's a great concept to get an entire house plumbing inspection in addition to a water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less critical things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>

There are two types of backflow - backpressure backflow and backsiphonage.</p>
