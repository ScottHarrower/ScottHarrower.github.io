<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual choice. A license is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages supplied changes are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line.

<p>Sometimes, our specialists will suggest that you replace your hot water heater rather than buy repairs. This is normally the case when the hot water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would amount to majority the cost of a whole brand-new system. In some cases a frustrating toilet just requires a small modification and life is back to typical. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a color test.</p>

Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
