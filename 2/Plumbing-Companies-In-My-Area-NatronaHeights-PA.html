<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
