Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
