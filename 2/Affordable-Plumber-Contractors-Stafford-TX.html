<p>The next action we should carry out in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be used to assure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
