<p>Root Intrusion: Root invasion refers to what takes place when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This occurs because the moisture in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can cause blockages, breaks, and back-ups which may result in extensive property damage. Watch out for wet, green spots in your backyard, a consistent sewage odor in or around your home, an uptick in insect and rodent activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all common signs of root invasion.</p>

Have your pipes examined as soon as possible so you do not wind up with a significant leak.</p>
