<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
