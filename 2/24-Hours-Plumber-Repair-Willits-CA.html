In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on dry or damp lawn sprinkler unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
