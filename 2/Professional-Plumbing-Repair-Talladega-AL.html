Be sure to purchase a circuitry package with the correct power rating and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). When you link the electrical wiring harness to the disposer, ensure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord.</p>

After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, considering that I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
