This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible contaminants can then get in the drinkable water system. The best method to lower accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of when a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral material, you may need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
<p>At least once every 3 months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or two assists eliminate the sediment.

To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your whole house when you spot a leak.</p>
