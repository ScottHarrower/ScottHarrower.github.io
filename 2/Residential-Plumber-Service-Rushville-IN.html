<p>During normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to open and discharge water to the exterior if either check valve should leak.

For this reason, the RPZ must be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and enable appropriate drainage.</p>
