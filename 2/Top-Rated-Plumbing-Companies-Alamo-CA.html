<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
