<h3>Why Plumbers Should Install Water Heaters in Westfield MA?</h3>
<p>Deterioration is a complicated phenomenon and there are many factors that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of corrosion control. Therefore, considering all these aspects, as well as arise from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
