The majority of houses in the United States, consisting of Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most common and devastating water problems: tough water.  Hard water damaged the modern-day house. Scale develops in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the life expectancy of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice machines. Difficult water damages warm water home appliances. The higher the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and solidify into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
