<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Shallotte NC</h3>
<p>We genuinely appreciate our customers and the services that we offer. As hard water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with salt ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, free" salt ions are launched into the water. The time between recharging cycles depends upon the solidity of the water, the quantity of water used, the size of the system and the capacity of the exchange media to eliminate solidity.</p>
