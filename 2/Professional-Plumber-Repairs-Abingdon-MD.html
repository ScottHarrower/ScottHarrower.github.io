<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
