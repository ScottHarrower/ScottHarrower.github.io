<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. In time, like any other device in your house, your garbage disposal. may need repairs. A disposal system may begin or clog to leak through heavy, or incorrect, usage. A leak someplace in the system may indicate a worn seal. Sometimes, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the entire system. This is where the UPC really enters into play.
