<p>Even small leaks can cause big repairs. Avoid getting soaked by employing a skilled, licensed pro.

Safety problems ought to be repaired instantly. This is where Precise Leak and Line comes in. We at Accurate Leak and Line are equipped to repair and diagnose or replace your sewer lines on both residential and commercial homes.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug set that I purchased independently from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Your disposer may feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the standard plumber's putty as described listed below. Both will produce a great seal (though the gasket might lead to percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is mainly a matter of choice. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
