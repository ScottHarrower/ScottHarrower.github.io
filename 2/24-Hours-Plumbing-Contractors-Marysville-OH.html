<p>The most convenient way to keep you and your family safe from the prospective hazards of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the very first location. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water feature or other type of cross connection, have an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>Backpressure might happen when the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not appropriately safeguarded, safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
