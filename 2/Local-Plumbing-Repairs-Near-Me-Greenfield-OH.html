A plumbing inspection can assist to identify whether you've got excess scaling within the pipes lowering the water pressure, or if there is a little leak that you don't know about.</p>
<p>Action 6: To link the drain, place the gasket in the discharge outlet. Then connect the discharge tube with the flange and bolts. Now hang the disposal by lining up the three tabs with the mounting ring. Use the included wrench to turn and lock the tabs over the ridges. Then link the dishwasher drain.
