<p>Sewer lines can fail for a range of factors, consisting of poor soil conditions, blockages from grease and gunk, and deterioration. Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older areas where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be two times as compounded if pipes have actually been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, wear or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be tested occasionally to guarantee they are working appropriately. A visual check of air spaces is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be checked with correctly calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
