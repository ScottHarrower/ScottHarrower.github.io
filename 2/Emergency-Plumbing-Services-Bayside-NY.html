<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line blockages are not something a house owner can fix.

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
