<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Beaumont CA</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be required to be found on the water service line, within the building, or both locations. After an initial inspection and testing of a newly set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is required to have the backflow preventer evaluated on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Inspect the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust just in your hot water. If you've never done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is probably coming from the inside of your water heater. If this is the case, replace your water heater as quickly as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you more than likely have rusted piping.</p>
