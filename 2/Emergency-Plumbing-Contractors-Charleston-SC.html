<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain Charleston SC</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these issues.</p>
<p>There are a number of signs to watch out for. 1) The surface area of the floor in one area is warm or even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all devices and components in the house have been shut off. 3) The hot water heater appears to be running all the time. 4) All this adds up to greater gas and water bills, in some cases very quickly.</p>
