<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the recently cleaned main drain. By including perseverence and perseverance the job was done to my complete fulfillment.</p>
<p>This is the next part to detach if you have a dishwasher that the system connects to. The only thing left after this is to detach it from the sink drain. This is done by supporting the base, loosening from the bottom up, and in the best direction. Clean the area of the waste that has inevitably built up throughout the years of use prior to putting in the new disposal.</p>
