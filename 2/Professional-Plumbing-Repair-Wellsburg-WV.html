<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the typical direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The circulation of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The stress of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Reduced Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the regular instructions.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a short-lived fix. It's a long-term solution for the whole plumbing system in your house or service.
