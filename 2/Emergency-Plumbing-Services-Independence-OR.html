<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Independence OR</h3>

Both are more labor-intensive than PVC and HDPE piping.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were prompt and really responsive to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were very professional and did an awesome job. I would certainly call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration just appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that needs to be dealt with immediately (you'll likely need a brand-new water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
