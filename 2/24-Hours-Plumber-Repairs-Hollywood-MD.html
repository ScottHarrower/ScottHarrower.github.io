When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Existing policies limit the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We offer two kinds of water treatment systems for hard water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>They do cost a fair bit more to install and buy, typically costing about twice that of a basic 50-gallon gas water heater.

The maker guarantee is typically about two times that of a tank-style also. There are lots of situations where a tankless hot water heater would be of excellent advantage for a busy household.</p>
