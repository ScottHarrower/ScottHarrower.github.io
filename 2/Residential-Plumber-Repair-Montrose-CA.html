<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board encourages the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections relating to the administration of Article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage occurs when there is a negative pressure in the water circulation system, which draws the water from a private water system into the general public water system. This can occur at any time, such as during a water pipe break or throughout a big firefighting effort.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the cause of the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
