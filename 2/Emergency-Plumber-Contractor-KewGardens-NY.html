<p>Sound is normal, but when you see that the sounds are all there however food is not being ground up it is likely that the motor has actually gone. Some noises suggest the need for repairs or a good clean out, and you can offer the system a great check before starting to price new ones.

<p>When a garbage disposal breaks, it is most likely only a matter of time before your sink begins to clog, as you and other house members are most likely not utilized to making sure that no obstructive food waste decreases your drain. Those liquified solids can cause a scaly accumulation on everything from meals, to pipes, to the heating elements of your home appliances, to your own body.
