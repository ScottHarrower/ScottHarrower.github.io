<p>The drains in the average house get consistent usage. Hair, food scraps, soap residue, and other particles can slowly build up over time. The drain will slowly slow up until it becomes entirely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners offered in stores have limited effectiveness. Although the drain may seem to clear initially, the result is often short-lived and the clog soon returns. Using these chemicals regularly can cause damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>In many cases, a lack of hot water is triggered by a malfunctioning circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. The dip tube inside the tank might be split if the water is lukewarm. Scalding water is normally the outcome of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and need to be instantly resolved by a skilled plumbing professional.</p>
