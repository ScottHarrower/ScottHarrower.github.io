<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Joelton TN</h3>

We can even repair or install a brand name brand-new garbage disposal so your kitchen is not only lovely, however it is functional too.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
