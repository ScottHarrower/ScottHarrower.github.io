<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Girard OH</h3>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line blockages are not something a property owner can fix. This type of clog needs a professional plumber or drain service technician to make use of a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line.

<p>To figure out if your house is a poly home," start with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it gets in the home near the water heater. Your main turned off is attached to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
