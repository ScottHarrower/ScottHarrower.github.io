<p>The cost associated with sewer line inspection might differ significantly based on your scenarios. House owners can generally anticipate a cost point in between $100 and $300, but obviously, this is just a rough quote.

If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, lower or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
