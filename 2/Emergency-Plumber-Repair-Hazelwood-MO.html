<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board recommends the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections concerning the administration of Post 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, consisting of licensing. Backsiphonage occurs when there is an unfavorable pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a personal water supply into the public water supply. This can occur at any time, such as throughout a water pipe break or during a large firefighting effort.</p>
<p>Before selection and installation, refer to manufacturers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies must be secured from freezing temperature levels and if set up where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly should be utilized.
