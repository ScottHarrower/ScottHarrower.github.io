A disposal system may clog or begin to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, use. A leak someplace in the system may show a used seal. In some cases, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the whole system. This is where the UPC truly enters into play. There are specific rules for where black iron gas pipes can be utilized, and where they can not. It can become an extremely severe safety hazard if used in an inaccurate location.</p>
