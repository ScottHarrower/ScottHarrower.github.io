<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to obtain a plumbing permit before setting up or changing a backflow preventer. Provided there isn't a tank failure, normally a commercial water heater can be repaired, but is it worth repairing? Only after addressing the following concerns must you respond to repair or replace. Do you know the number of years old your water heater is? Do you know how many years it's ranked for? If it is close to the number of years the water heater was ranked for, think about replacement rather of repair.</p>

<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided excellent service for us in replacing an extremely balky tub spout, and worn toilet parts. Not only was he very professional and comprehensive but he had the ability to answer all my questions worrying the service. I would offer 6 stars if I could. A video camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most effective methods of finding the precise whereabouts of a plumbing issue. A plumber will insert a specially designed water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live footage to identify where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
