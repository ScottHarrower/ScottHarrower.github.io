<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had supported into the downstairs bathroom sink.

I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
