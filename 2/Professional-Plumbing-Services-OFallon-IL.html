Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
