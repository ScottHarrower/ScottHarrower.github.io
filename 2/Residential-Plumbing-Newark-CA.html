<p>Cold showers? High energy expenses? It may be time for a brand-new warm water heater. But in order to profit of a brand-new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it set up appropriately. A water heater that is not set up properly can result in water damage, scalding temperatures, or even a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>A water softener ought to be set up as close to the water's point of entry into your house as possible.

For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, just one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
