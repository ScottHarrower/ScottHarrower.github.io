I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
