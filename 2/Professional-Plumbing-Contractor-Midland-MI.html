<p>Most residential houses have roofing seamless gutters that flow into downspout drains that direct water far from your home. When those downspouts are linked to underground drains that circulation to municipal storm drains or street rain gutters, they often end up being clogged with tree roots and particles. These kinds of obstructions cause gutters to overflow and the weight of the water can cause rain gutters to retreat from a home while causing water damage and rot to the structure.

<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

The resultant space breaks any potential siphon prior to it can happen, preventing contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more advanced and complicated backflow preventers.
