<p>Backflow preventers are important for developing a safe water system system. No matter which model you pick, all water softeners need to be correctly preserved. The salt water option should be mixed and kept in the brine tank. Periodic blocking of the resin likewise needs special attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, typical backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Similarly, germs and fungi also form mats in the resin that decrease its effectiveness. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these annoyances. Nevertheless, read the producer's directions before adding any chemicals to the unit.</p>
