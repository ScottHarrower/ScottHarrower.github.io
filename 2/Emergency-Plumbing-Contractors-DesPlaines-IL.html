<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
