After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or particles. This can be tricky, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to assure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc created and constructed a smaller sized model that operated on the same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains.

It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
