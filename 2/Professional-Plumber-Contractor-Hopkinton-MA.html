And who wants to do all that work??? In all severity however, making sure your journey lever is working well can conserve you the hassle of those little day-to-day troubles - that many people simply deal with and never ever recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to discuss the gallons of water wasted every day by a poor seal.</p>
