For the more serious clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Wingate plumber.</p>
<p>The space under your kitchen sink has gotten more congested over the years. Initially, there would have been a hot and cold  water line increasing to the faucet (normally with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Using liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless service technicians can treat in-place entire new areas of pipe within your harmed line, by means of small or perhaps pre-existing entry points.</p>
