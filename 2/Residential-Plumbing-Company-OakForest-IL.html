When dealing with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which helps use additional pressure to the clog. For clogs that occur further down the pipe, utilize a cable television auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made of long, versatile steel cable wound around a spindle with a hand crank. To use a cable television auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap below the sink, making sure it is not clogged prior to proceeding. Take out 18 inches of cable television at a time, crank the handle in a clockwise direction and press the auger forward at the exact same time. Repeat the procedure, taking out an additional 18 inches up until you break through the blockage. Often loose debris will settle into a new blockage. Follow with a plunger, if required.</p>

<p>In general, toilets are pretty easy to operate and repair. Practically any part can be removed and replaced relatively easily and rapidly The flipside of the toilet's low maintenance nature is, when it has a problem, the stakes are high. Damaged toilets can do some really comprehensive, pricey, and ... smelly damage to a house.

That's where High 5 Plumbing can be found in. With years of market experience, we know how to tackle a variety of drain problems.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the perpetrator. But not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.
