Natural gas storage tank systems use nearly 50% less energy, costing less to operate, than the electric range. However, they cost a bit more than electric models. When either temperature level or pressure exceeds preset levels, they also include a temperature level and pressure-release valve that opens. We offer gas water heater service, along with electric hot water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Shore.</p>
