<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services SanAnselmo CA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these concerns.</p>

These heaters typically last more than 20 years.</p>
