Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls under this brief area of pipe before it can reach the hot water heater's control valve. The needed length of the drip leg varies.</p>
<p>Energy Effectiveness. Choosing a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is recommended.
