<p>The appearance of your kitchen sink or bathroom sink can affect the total appearance of your home. Lots of homeowners buy beautiful and resilient granite countertops, marble counter tops, quartz counter tops, and more since they believe these are very durable and would last for several years. This is in fact real. In truth, countertops made from stone even add to the value of your home.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air.

This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
