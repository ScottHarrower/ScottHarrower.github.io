For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
