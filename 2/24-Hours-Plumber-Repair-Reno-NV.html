<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Plumbing problems aren't just difficult to identify, they're likewise efficient in causing some major damage. Pinhole leakages, for instance, are so little that they just launch a couple of droplets at a time.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
