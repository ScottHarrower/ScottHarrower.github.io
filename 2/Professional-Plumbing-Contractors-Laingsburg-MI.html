<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in Laingsburg MI</h3>

As one of the best plumbers in the Los Angeles area, our plumbers focus on offering energy efficient solutions that are cost reliable for the consumer. Low Circulation Toilets: While low circulation toilets are excellent at saving you money on your water bills, some older designs do not have the flushing power to properly remove waste, which leads to accumulations.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
