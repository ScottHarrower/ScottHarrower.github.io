<p>Hydro-jetting is a reliable method to completely clear your main sewer line. Most people typically refer to rooting as drain cleaning, however, this is not entirely accurate. Rootering a line with a drain machine breaks through a blockage causing a backup. Hydro-jetting is a separate type of service to completely clean the drain line.</p>
