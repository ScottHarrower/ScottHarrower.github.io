During regrowth, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
