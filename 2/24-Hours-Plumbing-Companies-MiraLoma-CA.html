<p>Gas is an essential energy we utilize every day to keep our offices and houses warm, our showers hot, and to cook our food. With the everyday usage of gas, it is easy to understand it is reasonable that over time a leak is bound to take place. When a leak appears, it is essential to know the indications, signs, and how to act. Remember to take safety measures when dealing with gas devices, utilize the aforementioned indications to recognize potential leakages, and call a plumber to have your gas lines regularly inspected and kept.</p>
<p>Energy Performance. Selecting a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is advisable. The energy efficiency of a storage water heater is indicated by its Energy Element (EF). The more efficient the hot water heater the greater the EF rating. However, just because a water heater has a higher EF worth, it does not always imply it will have lower operating expense. You also have to think about the fuel source.</p>
