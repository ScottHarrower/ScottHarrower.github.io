<p>Backflow is dangerous since it can pollute the public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and harmful chemicals. In 2010, for example, trainees at a Bowling Green, Kentucky primary school suffered queasiness and other signs after a contractor working on the HVAC system caused the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc developed and constructed a smaller model that operated on the same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It can cleaning big industrial and community sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
<p>Softeners generally eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically described as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they must be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a huge warning that something more serious is wrong with them.</p>
