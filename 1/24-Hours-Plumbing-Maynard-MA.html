<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

Water pressure might be or fail lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Trenchless Sewer Replacement Professionals: If you've had a sewer or drain back-up, opportunities are it's not the first and won't be the last.
