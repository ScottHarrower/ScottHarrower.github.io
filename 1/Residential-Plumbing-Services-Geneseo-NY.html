Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals bring positive charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with drinkable water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, potable and irrigation, you are also needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Geneseo NY</h3>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
