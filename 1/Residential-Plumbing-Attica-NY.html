<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might offer a quick fix in the short-term, it can trigger far more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

We will normally advise our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending upon the intensity of the circumstance.
