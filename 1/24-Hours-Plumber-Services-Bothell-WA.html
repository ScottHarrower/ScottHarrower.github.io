<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mostly time related. If whatever is all set, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and therefore the total costs. The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
