<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Bensenville IL</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
