For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas developed. Another feature of an electric hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated correctly using vents and ducts in order to work properly. With electric designs, you will not have to install any new vents or ducts in your home.</p>

Follow the guidelines that include the systems. Backflow preventers must be inspected yearly for appropriate operation. In areas where it freezes, the backflow preventer must be protected from freezing. See the Irrigation System Winterization tutorial for details.</p>
