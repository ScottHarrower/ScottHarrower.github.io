<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
