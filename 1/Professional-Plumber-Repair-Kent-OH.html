<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Kent OH</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium.

While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its many designated usages around your home.</p>
