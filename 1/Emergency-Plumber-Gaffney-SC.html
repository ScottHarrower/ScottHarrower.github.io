<p>Toilets can be tricky and finicky sometimes, depending on what parts have stopped working and the particular situation of your installation. Toilet repair or replacement can be a filthy job, something that many individuals may not feel comfy with doing.

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent double flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.

Proper care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
