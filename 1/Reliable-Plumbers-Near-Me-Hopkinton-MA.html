When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is capacity for the infected water to end up being a health hazard if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, along with checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
