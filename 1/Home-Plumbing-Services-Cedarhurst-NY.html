<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.

These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
