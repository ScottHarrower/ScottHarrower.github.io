<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
