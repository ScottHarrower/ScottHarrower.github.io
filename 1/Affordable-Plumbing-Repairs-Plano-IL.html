<p>The next step we should perform in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or particles. This can be difficult, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to assure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
