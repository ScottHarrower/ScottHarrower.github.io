<p>The easiest method to keep you and your household safe from the possible hazards of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the very first location.

<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
