Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
