<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for producing a safe supply of water system. No matter which design you select, all water softeners need to be properly preserved. The brine option must be blended and saved in the salt water tank. Periodic obstructing of the resin also needs unique attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, regular backwashing with water will resolve this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Also, germs and fungi also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these nuisances. Nevertheless, check out the producer's instructions before including any chemicals to the system.</p>
