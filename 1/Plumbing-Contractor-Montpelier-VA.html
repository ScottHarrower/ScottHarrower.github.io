If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed properly, you may experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
