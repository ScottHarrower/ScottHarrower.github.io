<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is an abrupt decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as throughout fire combating or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can produce a suction effect and draw prospective contaminants into the drinkable (drinking) water system. Storage tank water heaters are frequently found in most houses. Their parts are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's required. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver warm water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that from your water heater leaking, worse yet ... you show up house after a nice evening out just to discover your home or garage is flooded. Master plumbers will not allow any apprentice plumber, or unlicensed journeyman plumber, in their use or otherwise under their supervision, to do plumbing work of any kind, including repairs and clearing interruptions of drains, unless stated master plumber is physically present and taking an active part in stated work.</p>
