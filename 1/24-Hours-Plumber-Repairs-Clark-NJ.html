By having the anode rod checked frequently and replaced as needed, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this article about liners. I discover that numerous old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are stating. Since they don't like the innovation and not because it does not work, will also say something doesn't work well merely. If this heater is installed in a house with numerous restrooms, the piping process adds to the installation costs.</p>
