<p>The drains in the average home get constant usage. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other particles can slowly develop gradually. The drain will gradually slow until it ends up being completely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners offered in shops have actually restricted effectiveness. Although the drain might appear to clear initially, the result is often momentary and the clog soon returns. Using these chemicals often can trigger damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>Throughout installation, electrical power and water are shut down to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are removed and cleaned up of any putty. Loosen up the nuts that connect the drain pipe, including the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Utilize your hands for PVC connections or a pipe wrench for metal connections. Place a pail below the drain pipe to capture any water that leaks out.</p>
