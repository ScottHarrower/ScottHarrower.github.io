<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets must absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet ought to be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
