<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct impact on your safety, convenience, convenience, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is very important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Existing policies restrict the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two kinds of water treatment systems for hard water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to use salt pellets in the brine tank, but then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will get rid of salt from the water, which you can use for drinking and cooking. From multi-tank systems powered by the energy of moving water to a more standard approach, Kinetico covers all your choices. Your local Kinetico water expert will work with you to choose the water softener that's right for you.</p>
