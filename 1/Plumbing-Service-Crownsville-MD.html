<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - primarily with sinks.

<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 โฒ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
