<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - primarily with sinks. For the most part, a sink drain concern is triggered by extreme contaminants or particles inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care items or soaps. While there are several chemical drain cleaning alternatives, in some cases this can trigger more damage than aid. Anytime you discover a clogged drain, reach out to Resurrection Plumbing to identify the issue and suggest the right repairs.</p>
<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve.

<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
