An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
