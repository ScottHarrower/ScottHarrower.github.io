A hissing noise getting away nearby gas lines is indicative of a big gas leak. If you hear the noise of air (or gas) by force leaking out of a pipe, you need to follow safety precautions and resolve the leak instantly.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that of unfavorable or reduced pressure in the supply side of the water system, back siphonage occurs when water is drawn or pulled backward. Contaminated water can be pulled into the supply line from sprinklers or other emitters if the irrigation line does not have a backflow preventer at the cross-connection.
