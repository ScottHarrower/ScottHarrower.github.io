<p>When selecting the proper system security there are numerous considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on a specific basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems consists of the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire defense system are created to match the hazard that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be really various, we need to comprehend that the fire security system for any installation needs to be designed and installed to meet that specific risk or need. An airplane garage will need a really various fire security system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these 2 examples would also vary greatly.</p>
