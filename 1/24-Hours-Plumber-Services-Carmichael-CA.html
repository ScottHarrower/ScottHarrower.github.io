<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Carmichael CA</h3>
<p>We really care about our consumers and the services that we supply. As hard water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with sodium ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, free" sodium ions are launched into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends on the hardness of the water, the amount of water used, the size of the system and the capability of the exchange media to remove firmness.</p>
