<p>Surprise water leaks are often difficult and have Potentially Serious Repercussions. Changing your flapper may need a little different steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however chances are you'll locate among the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
