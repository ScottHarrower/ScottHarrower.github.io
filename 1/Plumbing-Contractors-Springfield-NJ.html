<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your house can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Just because copper is showing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes.

<p>There are 2 kinds of products used to build a garbage disposal unit: aluminum and stainless-steel. The typical cost of an aluminum waste disposal unit varies from $60 to $150, while a stainless steel garbage disposal has an average cost of just over $150.

<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon.

This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
