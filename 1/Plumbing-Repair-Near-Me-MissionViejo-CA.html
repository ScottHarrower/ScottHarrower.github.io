<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- generally sodium. The result is water that's been effectively softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that make up difficult water.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
