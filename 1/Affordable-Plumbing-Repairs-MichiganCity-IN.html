<h3>Shower Repairs in MichiganCity IN - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
