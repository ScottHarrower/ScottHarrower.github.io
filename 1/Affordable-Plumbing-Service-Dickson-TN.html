The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is coming into the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the wrong way. There are 2 different types of testable backflow prevention devices that are frequently defined-- a minimized pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a few others that I will discuss but do not get hung up on them. I mention them just since they will be on a certification test.</p>
