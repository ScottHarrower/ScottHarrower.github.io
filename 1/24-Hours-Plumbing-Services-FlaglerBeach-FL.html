<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in locations where water could trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
