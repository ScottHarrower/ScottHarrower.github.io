<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections.

Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, use or tiredness. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed.
