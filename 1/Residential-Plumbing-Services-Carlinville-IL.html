<p>Conventional tank-type water heaters include steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a large tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and then launched into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you surpass a preset level. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperatures and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
