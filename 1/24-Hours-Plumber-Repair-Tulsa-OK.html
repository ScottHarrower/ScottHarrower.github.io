<p>This is a totally legitimate concern that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, naturally, as crucial as your water heater, water line, or drains. Nonetheless, it includes a fair amount of performance to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a relatively small cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any product particles by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such particles. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if the clog is further down the sewer line, needing unique equipment to be brought in, it will cost more, especially if floor covering has to be pulled up or the toilet needs to be restored. If you have a manual snake, you can try to separate the clog yourself first before calling a professional. Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of circulation of nonpotable water or other compounds through a cross-connection and into the piping of a public water system or customer's potable water supply. There are 2 types of backflow - backpressure backflow and backsiphonage.</p>
