<p>Wood pipes were used in London and in other places throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system providing the make-up water. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Prospective pollutants can then get in the potable water supply. The very best way to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
