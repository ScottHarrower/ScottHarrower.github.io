<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, however how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Often the type and installation requirements are defined by local statutes and ecological regulations. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon before it can happen, avoiding polluting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complicated and advanced backflow preventers.

<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these problems.</p>
