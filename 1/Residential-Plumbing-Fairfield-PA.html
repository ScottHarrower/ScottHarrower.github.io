<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in locations where water could trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
