<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
