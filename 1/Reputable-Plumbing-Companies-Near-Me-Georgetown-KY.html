Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
