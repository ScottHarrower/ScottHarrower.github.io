<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The standard means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The fundamental mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, utilize the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it complimentary. A number of homes in my neighborhood being repiped and have spoken to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't identified soon, obviously it starts with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can cause significant damage.</p>
