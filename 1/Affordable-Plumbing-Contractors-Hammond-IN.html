Sprinkler Warehouse does not advise AVB's for irrigations systems where there is a possible to contaminate drinking water. AVB's are not testable and it is not possible to discover when one has actually stopped working.</p>

See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
