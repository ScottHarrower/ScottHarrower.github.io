<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Houses that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based). You might not desire to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration normally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
