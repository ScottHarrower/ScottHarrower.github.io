<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Portsmouth VA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day.
