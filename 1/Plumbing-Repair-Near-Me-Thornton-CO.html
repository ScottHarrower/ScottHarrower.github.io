<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Thornton CO</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
