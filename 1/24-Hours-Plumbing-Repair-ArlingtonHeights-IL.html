<p>Providing quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>We had an excellent experience with Joe Boyette, he was extremely professional, polite, competent. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month period. We also needed to replace a bathroom and a water heater unassociated to the fire, but we felt confident in Joe's capabilities. We decided to stick with Joe, despite the fact that we felt Mr Rooter costs were certainly on the high-end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
