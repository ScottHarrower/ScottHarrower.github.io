Worms for irrigation systems: Citizens found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the atmospheric pressure breaker malfunctioned on an independently owned underground sprinkler system. Throughout a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system drew some water from the sprinkler into the city water.

Water pressure may be or fail minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
