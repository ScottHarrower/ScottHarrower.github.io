<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
