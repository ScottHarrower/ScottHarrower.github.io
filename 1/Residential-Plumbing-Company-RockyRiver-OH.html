<p>Throughout regular operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to open and discharge water to the exterior. An RPZ will regularly discharge small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow appropriate drainage.</p>
