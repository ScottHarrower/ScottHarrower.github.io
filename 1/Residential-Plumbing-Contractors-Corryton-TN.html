<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system.

Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
