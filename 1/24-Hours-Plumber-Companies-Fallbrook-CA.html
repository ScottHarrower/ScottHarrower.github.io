<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Fallbrook CA?</h3>
<p>SofTap's water softening innovation is well-suited for household, commercial, and commercial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale build-up in homes and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, along with improving current reverse osmosis treatment systems. The technology is simpler and more cost-effective than other softening systems on the market today that use zeolites, which must be restored using brine, or membrane nanofiltration that requires significant water usage and high pressure.</p>
<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
