<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
