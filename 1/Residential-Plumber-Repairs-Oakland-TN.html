<p>A lot of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the external finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
