<p>During normal operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, described as the zone of minimized pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is developed to discharge and open water to the outside if either check valve should leak. An RPZ will regularly discharge small amounts of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
