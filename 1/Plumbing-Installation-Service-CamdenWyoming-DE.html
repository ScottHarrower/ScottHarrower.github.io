<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
