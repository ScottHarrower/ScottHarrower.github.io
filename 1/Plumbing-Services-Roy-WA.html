<p>If you have actually checked out the paragraph above, you now comprehend that there numerous mechanical parts within your toilet's tank that enable your toilet to flush the water down the toilet bowl. When these parts become worn or break they need to be changed. This is a task that some homeowner know how to deal with, but there are many who do not know how to properly repair their toilet and may be afraid they will buy the wrong part or just make matters worse. If you are one who falls into the latter category, then your best option is to give Olin Plumbing a call, we understand how to fix any toilet and the appropriate parts to use.

<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>So, if you want to stop needing to jiggle your toilet manage every time you flush and are sick and tired of posting respectful signs in your bathroom everytime you have people over, get a new trip lever that actually works for your toilet. While certain specialized flush valves or flappers might require a particular trip lever to work correctly, many toilets will work just great with a "will fit" lever - which is good news for individuals who can't find their design number or who maybe have actually redesigned or updated their fixtures and desire a different surface or design deal with to match the rest of their bathroom design.</p>
