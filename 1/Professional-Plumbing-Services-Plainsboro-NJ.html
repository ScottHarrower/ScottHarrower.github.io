<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
