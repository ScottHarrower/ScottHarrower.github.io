<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Danville CA</h3>
<p>Marin H2O is a professional plumbing and water treatment expert located in San Rafael, CA. We proudly serve residential and commercial customers throughout Marin County, California.

<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
