<p>In water distribution systems, water is normally preserved at a significant pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
