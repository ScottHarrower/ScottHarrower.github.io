Its sole task is to prevent drinking water from being infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to avoid backflow. The standard means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
