<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, however it does take place more frequently than you think! Typically it happens during the night when you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
