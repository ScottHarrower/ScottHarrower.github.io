<p>Backflow preventers need to only be fixed when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has degraded in its performance listed below the developed minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
