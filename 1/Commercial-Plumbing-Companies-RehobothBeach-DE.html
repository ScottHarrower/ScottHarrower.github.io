Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water actually needs it.

<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent.
