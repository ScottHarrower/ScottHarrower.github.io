<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat if permitted to return to the water supply.
