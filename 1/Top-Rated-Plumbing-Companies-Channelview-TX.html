Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
