<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains substantial quantities of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of designated uses around your house.</p>

<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
