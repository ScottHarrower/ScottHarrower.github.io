<p>IRWD is committed to providing safe, high quality water to clients. Our substantial water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water provided to our clients is kept devoid of hazardous contaminants. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices including a nonpotable substance, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination may take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the safe and clean water supply. This can happen through a process referred to as backflow.</p>
<p>Water firmness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Since soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum, the factor you can feel the difference on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term firmness" came from ... it's hard to clean in.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
