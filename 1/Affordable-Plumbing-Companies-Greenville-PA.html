<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Greenville PA</h3>
<p>The most effective method to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Our group can assist you with your water heater needs too. Permit our team to do the work for you if you need to repair your water heater or replace it. We guarantee the work is done properly every time. Most of our customers remain in Montgomery County, although we make toilet repairs in Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia, too.
