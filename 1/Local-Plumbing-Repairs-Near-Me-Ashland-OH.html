<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your security, convenience, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is exceptionally important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Present policies limit the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for tough water: Benefit Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic products, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than products consisting of harsh chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>

Salt ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, totally free" salt ions are launched into the water. The time in between charging cycles depends upon the hardness of the water, the amount of water used, the size of the unit and the capability of the exchange media to remove hardness.</p>
