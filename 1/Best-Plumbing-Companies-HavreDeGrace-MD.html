<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the home. Houses that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have kids, you may not wish to reside in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
