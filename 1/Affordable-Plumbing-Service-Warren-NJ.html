<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is among the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and benefit back siphonage only for non-health threat or health danger conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It needs to also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect versus back siphonage.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be constantly monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed.

Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
