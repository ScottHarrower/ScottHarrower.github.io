<p>Leaks can occur if the seal in between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain fails. Due to the fact that the tank or the whole toilet should be raised off the floor for an appropriate repair, either of these leaks can be challenging to fix by yourself.

<p>At least as soon as every 3 months, drain water from the tank. Over time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper efficiency, and draining a gallon or so helps eliminate the sediment. If you identify a leak and choose a patching task rather of a repiping task, just remember that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the exact same product and they may be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to consider repiping your whole home when you spot a leak.</p>
