<h3>Professional Experience Is Essential For A Good Plumber ThousandOaks CA</h3>
<p>We truly appreciate our consumers and the services that we provide. As hard water goes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with sodium ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, free" sodium ions are released into the water. The time between recharging cycles depends on the solidity of the water, the amount of water used, the size of the unit and the capacity of the exchange media to get rid of firmness.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
