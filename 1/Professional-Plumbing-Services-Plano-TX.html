<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for effectiveness, in addition to examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
