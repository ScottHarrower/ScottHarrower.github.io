Blanc likewise developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It can cleaning big commercial and local sewer pipes.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
