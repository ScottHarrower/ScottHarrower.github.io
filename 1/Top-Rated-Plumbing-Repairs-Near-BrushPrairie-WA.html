This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely gets rid of hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
