<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your house.

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If enabled to return to the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
