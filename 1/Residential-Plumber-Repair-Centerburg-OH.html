<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll observe that water goes to fill up the bowl. Nevertheless, in a correctly working toilet, the water ought to stop running as soon as the bowl is filled to its appropriate capability. Chances are you have an internal leak and water is being discarded down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leaks are exceptionally wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>

After softening a large amount of difficult water, the exchange medium becomes coated with calcium and magnesium ions. The exchange medium must be charged or regenerated (Figure 1)when this takes place.
