<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

On the other hand, lacks of workers may occur in some areas throughout peak periods of structure activity.</p>
