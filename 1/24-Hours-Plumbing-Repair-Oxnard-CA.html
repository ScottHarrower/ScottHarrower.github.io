The next common problem that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it decreases the offered volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are harmless, however over time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by ecological regulations and local statutes.

The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can occur, avoiding contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more advanced and complicated backflow preventers.
