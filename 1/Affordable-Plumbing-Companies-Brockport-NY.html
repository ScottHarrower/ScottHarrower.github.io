<p>When the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>

<p>When the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its efficiency below the developed minimum basic, backflow preventers should only be fixed. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow.
