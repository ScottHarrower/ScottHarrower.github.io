<p>New houses built with copper pipes are particularly prone to corrosive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had a chance to become covered within. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of 3 to five months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
