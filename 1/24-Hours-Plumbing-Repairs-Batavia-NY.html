<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
