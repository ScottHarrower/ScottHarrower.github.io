<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I purchased separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
