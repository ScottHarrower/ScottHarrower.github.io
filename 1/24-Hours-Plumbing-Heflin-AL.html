This normally includes cracks in the toilet bowl itself, extensive corrosion over several elements, or simply due to the fact that you  wish to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
<p>All devices or systems supplied by safe and clean water lines that might undergo contamination must have airgaps (Ct. Regs. § 19-13-38a( b )).
