Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.
