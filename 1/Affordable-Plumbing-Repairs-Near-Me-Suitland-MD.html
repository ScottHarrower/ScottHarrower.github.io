<p>Noticeable odor. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the yard, basement, or anywhere in your house or business location, give us a call. That smell might be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and manages atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has failed, it will typically need to be changed rather than repaired. If your pipes are gurgling or giving off foul odors, you'll know this.</p>

Soon, your water and sewage will be flowing freely once again and you won't have to stress over drains and sewer lines anymore.</p>
