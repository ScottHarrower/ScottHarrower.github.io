<p>Corrosion is an intricate phenomenon and there are many factors that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate rust Also, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of rust control. Thus, considering all these factors, as well as results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this article about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are saying.

A number of houses in my neighborhood being repiped and have actually talked to neighbors about the problems leading up to this.
