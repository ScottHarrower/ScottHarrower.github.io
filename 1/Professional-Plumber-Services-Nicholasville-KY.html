<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the drinkable system supplying the makeup water. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its instructions of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Prospective impurities can then get in the drinkable water system. The best method to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically difficult with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
