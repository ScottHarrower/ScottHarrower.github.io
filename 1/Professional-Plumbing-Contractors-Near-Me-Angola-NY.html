<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That slow, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water spots and corrosion. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
