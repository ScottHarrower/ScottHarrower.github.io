Channeling happens when the incoming difficult water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you have actually ever noticed that the busier your company is, the better your cleaning agent works, the perpetrator might be an extra-large softener.</p>
<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the glory in the toilet world, however the trip lever is the bridge between guy and machine. After all, if the trip lever does not raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to jiggle and wiggle and often even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper manually. And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness however, making sure your trip lever is working well can conserve you the inconvenience of those little daily hassles - that the majority of people simply cope with and never realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water wasted every day by a bad seal.</p>

That smell may be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your home, releases sewer gas, and manages air pressure in the waste-system pipes has failed, it will frequently need to be replaced rather than repaired.
