While there are products on the market that provide a diy remedy, these usually provide just a momentary fix and can cause bigger problems later. Our technicians have the appropriate tools to rid your drains of their obstructions without harming your pipes or the environment. For all of your drain cleaning needs, call us - the local experts! Give us a call at 855-783-6113.</p>
<p>Borax sits in the precise very same household of water softeners as washing soda. Borax is a precipitating water softener and it features the very same drawbacks i.e. skin inflammation and accumulation.

Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>

<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the offender. But not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
