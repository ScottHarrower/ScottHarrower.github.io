<p>If there are any lead pipes in the home, discover out. Residences that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an environmental toxin (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not wish to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>At least once every three months, drain water from the tank. Gradually sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon approximately helps eliminate the sediment. If you find a leak and opt for a patching job instead of a repiping job, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the very same product and they might be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your whole house when you find a leak.</p>
