Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
