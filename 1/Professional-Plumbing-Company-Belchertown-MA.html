<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct result on your safety, convenience, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is very crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system. Present guidelines restrict the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines.
