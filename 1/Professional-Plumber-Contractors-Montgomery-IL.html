<p>The majority of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the outer covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
