<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system needs to be continually kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
