Depending on the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or sanitize bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit. Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you need to think about the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration.

<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
