<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
