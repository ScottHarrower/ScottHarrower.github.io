<p>You reside in an older home. There's a great opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not currently have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
