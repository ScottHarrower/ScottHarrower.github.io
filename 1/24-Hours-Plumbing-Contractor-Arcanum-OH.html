<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water spots and corrosion. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
