<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service HamptonBays NY</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these issues.</p>
