<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
