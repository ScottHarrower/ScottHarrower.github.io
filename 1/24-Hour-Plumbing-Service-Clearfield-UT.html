<p>Woodbury, together with lots of other neighborhoods and organizations, has found the very best way to prevent these discolorations from happening is by reducing the variety of times your water softener restores. "Restoring" refers to the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or full. Nevertheless, numerous water softeners restore too often, when the filter medium really isn't complete. This can be fixed by simply resetting your water softener to eliminate less firmness or to run longer in between regrowth cycles.</p>
