<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
