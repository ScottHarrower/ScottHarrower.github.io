<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water streams in the typical instructions from the supplier, downstream to fill the user's need. The circulation of water presses the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure distinction in the Zone of Lowered Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the normal instructions.</p>
