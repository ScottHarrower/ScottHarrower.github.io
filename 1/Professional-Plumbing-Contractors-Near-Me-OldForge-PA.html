<h3>Blocked Sewer in OldForge PA - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
