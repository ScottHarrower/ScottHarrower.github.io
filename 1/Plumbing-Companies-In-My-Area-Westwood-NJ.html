<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of elements that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up corrosion Also, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of corrosion control. Thus, considering all these aspects, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to provide some kind of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're dealing with installing it.
