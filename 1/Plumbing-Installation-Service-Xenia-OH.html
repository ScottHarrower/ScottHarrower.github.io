<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Xenia OH</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
