<h3>Clogged Bathtub Drain in SheffieldLake Ohio</h2>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
