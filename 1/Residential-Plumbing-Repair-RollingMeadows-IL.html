<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber RollingMeadows IL</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
