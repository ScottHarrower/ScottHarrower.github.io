<p>In most cases, the toilet can be repaired instead of changed, given that the issue frequently boils down to a single part or 2. Often, nevertheless, the damage is so extensive that you either need to replace the entire toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is simply a more useful option.

The proper backflow prevention device is required if an air space is not possible.
