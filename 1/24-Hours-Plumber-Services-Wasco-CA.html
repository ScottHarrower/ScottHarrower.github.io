<p>The next action we need to carry out in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be made use of to ensure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>

If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist identify.</p>
