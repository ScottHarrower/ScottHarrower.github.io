<p>Softeners primarily eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically described as 'solidity minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they should be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a huge red flag that something more serious is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>Water heater repair and water heater installation are often postponed as long as possible. A hot water heater is a pricey plumbing device, and we tend to press off replacing it up until it breaks beyond repair. It is also a piece of plumbing equipment that we forget up until we awaken to a cold shower. We may hear the water heater making sounds, attempting to inform us there is an issue, however we neglect it which might lead to a more extensive repair that if we would have nipped it in the bud. It's important to get out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you react to a problem, the better opportunity you'll have to save money and time on hot water heater services.</p>
