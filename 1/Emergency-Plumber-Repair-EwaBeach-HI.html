Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
