When you experience blockages in numerous drains at the same time in your house, then that usually implies that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in multiple places and any combination of drains. For instance, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
