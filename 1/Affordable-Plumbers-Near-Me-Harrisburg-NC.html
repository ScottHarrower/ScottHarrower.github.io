Water conditioners are gadgets that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to use salt.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
