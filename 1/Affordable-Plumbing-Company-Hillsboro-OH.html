After we have cleaned up the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be difficult, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be made use of to ensure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
