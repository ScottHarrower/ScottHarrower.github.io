<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break because you can smell nasty smells or you have a sewage back-up in your house. It is essential to determine the precise location of the break in your sewer line. Often times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can save you countless dollars in repairs. Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can fix the problem. The service technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance company, realtor or city inspector.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a failing waste disposal unit, or excessive food being disposed down the drain. We will usually advise our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending upon the severity of the scenario. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells foul, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
