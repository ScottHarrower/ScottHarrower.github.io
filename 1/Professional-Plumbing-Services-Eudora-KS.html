<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
