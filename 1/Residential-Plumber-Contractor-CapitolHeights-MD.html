<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
