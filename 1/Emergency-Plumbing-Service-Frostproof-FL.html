<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has space to hang on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As hard water passes through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Considering that the solidity minerals have a higher positive charge than the sodium, they will knock the salt ions off and take their location.</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing can give a house soft water like a water softener. And the advantages of treating that water even with a water softener far out weigh the damages caused by our extremely hard water. If you like the method the water feels, you don't consume water from it unless you utilize a reverse osmosis system, and you take pleasure in all the other benefits of the soft water and do not mind the inconvenience of salt bags and examining changing the anode rod more often then a conventional water softener is perfect for you.</p>

<p>Softeners generally remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically referred to as 'solidity minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a huge warning that something more serious is wrong with them.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it complimentary. Numerous homes in my community being repiped and have spoken with neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can trigger major damage if the leak isn't found quickly.</p>
