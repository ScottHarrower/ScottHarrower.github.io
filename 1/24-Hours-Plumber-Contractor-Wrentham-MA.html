<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
