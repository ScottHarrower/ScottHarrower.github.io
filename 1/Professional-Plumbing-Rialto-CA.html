<p>In many cases, our service technicians will recommend that you replace your water heater instead of purchase repairs. This is normally the case when the hot water heater is more than ten years old or the cost of repairs would amount to majority the cost of a whole new system. In some cases a bothersome toilet just requires a small adjustment and life is back to regular. That is why we offer a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a dye test.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the concern. You may have to look into utilizing a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. There are 2 basic piping products utilized by plumbing professionals. PEX and copper both provide many advantages and advantages such as eliminating the metallic taste from your water.</p>
