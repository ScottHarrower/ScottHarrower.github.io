<p>A lot of plumbers will get rid of the old system to install the new one at the same per hour rate. This can increase the quantity of time required to install the new unit, therefore increasing expenses. This really depends on what condition the remainder of the pipes are in, and how difficult the old system is to get rid of. In a lot of cases, elimination will only include an additional $25 to $50 to the overall costs, however sometimes the expenses could be greater if extra pipes need to also be replaced.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug kit that I purchased independently from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
