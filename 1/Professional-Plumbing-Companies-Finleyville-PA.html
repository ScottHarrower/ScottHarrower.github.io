<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A garbage disposal is a necessary kitchen device in most houses today. While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can handle practically any type of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other item jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Used impellers on older disposals can end up being inefficient, increasing the danger of drain blockages.</p>
