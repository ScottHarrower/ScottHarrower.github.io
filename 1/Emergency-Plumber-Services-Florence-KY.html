We made the decision to stick with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter rates were definitely on the high end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

<p>Wood pipes were used in London and somewhere else throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
