<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and in other places throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug package that I purchased separately from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Your company has been extremely useful to me for some time. The young man who came a few days back was so truthful with me. I was prepared to invest a minimum of $500 for a hot water system and he said it wasn't required!!!! He could have set up the system and I 'd never ever have actually understood the difference. That's a quality company. . Setting up a waste disposal unit is a relatively easy job for an experienced do-it-yourselfer. Grab a couple of standard tools and follow our how-to.</p>
