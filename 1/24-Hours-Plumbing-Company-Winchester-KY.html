<p>Electric water heaters do have a couple of disadvantages however that are worth mentioning. Most importantly, electrical energy is not as inexpensive as gas. Some utility companies charge higher rates for electricity during peak periods such as very early in the early morning and in the evening.

Another downside of an electrical hot water heater is that they can be expensive to install, especially when it pertains to whole-house tankless systems.</p>
