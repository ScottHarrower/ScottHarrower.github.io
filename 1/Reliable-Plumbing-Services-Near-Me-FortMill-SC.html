<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
