<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
