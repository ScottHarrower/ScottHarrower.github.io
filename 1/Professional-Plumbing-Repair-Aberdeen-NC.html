<p>She knew about the service call fee. The 4 On Your Side Investigation discovered that's a typical charge. Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a price quote from personal plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would offer a price quote over the phone. All of them wished to look at the situation before dedicating to a cost, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
