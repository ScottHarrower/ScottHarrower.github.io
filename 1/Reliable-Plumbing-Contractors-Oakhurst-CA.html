<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Oakhurst CA</h3>
<p>This is especially common after returning from a holiday or not utilizing your house's water supply for a prolonged time period.

We have a dedicated team of experienced, highly-skilled, and professional plumbers who are at the helm of fixing all kinds of sinks.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove particles such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
