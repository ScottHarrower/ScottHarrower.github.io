<p>Root Intrusion: Root invasion describes what takes place when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This occurs because the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can trigger obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which might lead to substantial residential or commercial property damage.

<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were timely and extremely responsive to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were very professional and did a remarkable task.

Now, if this discoloration just appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes.
