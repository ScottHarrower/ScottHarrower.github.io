<p>At least once every three months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper performance, and draining a gallon approximately helps eliminate the sediment. If you spot a leak and select a patching job rather of a repiping job, just keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the same product and they may be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your entire house when you spot a leak.</p>
