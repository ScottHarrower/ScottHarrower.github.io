<p>Fixing a leaky faucet seems like an easy job, but sometimes the circumstance can be stealthily made complex. Sometimes it's best to hire a certified plumber to ensure the root cause of the leak is properly recognized and addressed the very first time, instead of making a number of trips to the hardware shop and purchasing a range of parts just to end up precisely where you started, or even worse, creating an even larger mess.

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right now.
