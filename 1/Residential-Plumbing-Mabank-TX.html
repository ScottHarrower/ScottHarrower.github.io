<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
