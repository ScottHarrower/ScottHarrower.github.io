<p>Leaks are tricky. Drains clog over time. In cooking areas, greases, soaps and more build up on the walls of the pipes and cause a clog. In restrooms, showers, tubs and sinks ended up being clogged with hair and soap, and toilets can become clogged with bathroom tissue. You need the assistance of a plumber experienced in drain cleaning when this occurs. While there are items on the market that use a diy remedy, these often provide just a short-lived fix and can cause bigger problems later on.
