When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that only original factory repair parts are used.

<p>Inspect the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust just in your hot water. If you have actually never done this on your own, you might need a professional to do this.
