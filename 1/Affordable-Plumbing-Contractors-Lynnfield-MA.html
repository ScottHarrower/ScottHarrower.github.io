Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
