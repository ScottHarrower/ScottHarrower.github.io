<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Chappaqua NY</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
