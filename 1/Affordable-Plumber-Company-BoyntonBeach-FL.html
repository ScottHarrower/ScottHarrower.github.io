<p>Anti-Scale Devices: Some hot water heater promote features that reduce mineral scale accumulation by churning water in the bottom of the tank. Features such as these include cost, and aren't that reliable. Your best method is to get the water heater with the 12 year guarantee.

<p>The customer has 1 month to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (examine the due date on Notice of Requirements form). The majority of the time, a professional plumber can come out and discover the issue and make the repairs. In some circumstances, the toilet may be too old, and replacement parts are not available, so a replacement toilet is required.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a short-term fix. It's an irreversible option for the entire plumbing system in your house or company. We shut off the supply of water, eliminate old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the brand-new system is set up, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the brand-new system. Once the system passes our tests, it's great to opt for you.</p>
