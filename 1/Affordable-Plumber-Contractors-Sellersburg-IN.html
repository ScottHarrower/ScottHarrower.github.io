<p>As soon as the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
