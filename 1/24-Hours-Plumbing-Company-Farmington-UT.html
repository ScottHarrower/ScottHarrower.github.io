<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
