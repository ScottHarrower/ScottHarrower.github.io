Commercial water supply normally has a minimum standard of quality, depending upon the industrial procedure in concern. Farming on the other hand has less strict water quality requirements. But where backflow preventers are most vital remains in the supply of potable water for domestic and individual usage.</p>

<p>A minimum of when every three months, drain water from the tank. Gradually sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or so helps eliminate the sediment.
