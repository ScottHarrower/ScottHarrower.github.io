<p>You have probably seen drain cleaner products on the shelves at your local house enhancement store, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining pipes water like it should, you might be lured to head down there and select some up to fix it on your own. These products, after all, make the procedure seem pretty basic. Unfortunately it's not as simple as you may think, and those items are not always going to fix the issue. In most cases it's more helpful to hire a professional plumber in Utah.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it changed if your water heater has actually required several repairs over the last couple of years. A great general rule for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the life-span of the typical hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>
<p>Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem became worse. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive alternative.</p>
