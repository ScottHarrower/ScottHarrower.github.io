<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system offering the makeup water, backpressure is developed. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Potential pollutants can then enter the safe and clean water system. The best way to lower build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the traditional plumber's putty as laid out below. Both will develop an excellent seal (though the gasket might lead to small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is mainly a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
