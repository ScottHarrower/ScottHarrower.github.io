<p>If you're living in an old home that's never been remodelled, you might be handling regular plumbing issues.

Due to this lime scale build-up, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is lowered. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for example, 100 psi) pushes against the # 1 check and also fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pressing it closed.</p>
