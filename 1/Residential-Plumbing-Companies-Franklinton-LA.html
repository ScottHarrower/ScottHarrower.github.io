<p>Backflow preventers are critical for producing a safe water system system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be appropriately maintained. The brine solution must be blended and kept in the salt water tank. Regular obstructing of the resin also needs unique attention. For example, if the raw supply of water is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, normal backwashing with water will resolve this issue. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Likewise, fungis and germs also form mats in the resin that lower its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these problems. Nevertheless, check out the manufacturer's guidelines before including any chemicals to the system.</p>
