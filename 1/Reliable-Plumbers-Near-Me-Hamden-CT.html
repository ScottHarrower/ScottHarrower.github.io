<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Hamden CT</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
