<p>2 styles of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be utilized to isolate health or non-health dangers but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>The system has returned to an absolutely no demand condition (no valves open downstream).

When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
