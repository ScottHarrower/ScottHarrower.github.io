<p>As soon as the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>

<p>Water hardness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium.
