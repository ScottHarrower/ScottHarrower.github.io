<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the easiest design of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least costly, but also the least reliable alternative. These devices are not designed as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one must be set up at every control valve. Sprinkler Storage facility does not recommend AVB's for irrigations systems where there is a prospective to pollute drinking water. AVB's are not testable and it is not possible to identify when one has actually failed.</p>
