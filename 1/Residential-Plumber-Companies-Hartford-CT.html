<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
