<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at ShermanOaks CA</h3>
<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are lots of elements that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that accelerate rust Likewise, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of corrosion control. Thus, considering all these factors, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
