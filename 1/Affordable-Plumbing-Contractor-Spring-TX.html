This can increase the amount of time required to install the brand-new unit, therefore increasing costs. This truly depends on what condition the rest of the pipes remain in, and how tough the old unit is to eliminate. In many cases, removal will only add an additional $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, but in some cases the expenses might be higher if extra pipes need to likewise be changed.</p>
