You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed appropriately, you might experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in lost water.</p>
