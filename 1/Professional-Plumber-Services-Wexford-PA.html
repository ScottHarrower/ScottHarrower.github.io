<p>IRWD is committed to delivering safe, high quality water to consumers. Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept devoid of damaging contaminants. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices including a nonpotable compound, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the potable water system. This can take place through a process called backflow.</p>
<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the normal instructions from the supplier, downstream to fill the user's need. The circulation of water presses the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Reduced Pressure. This distinction in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water streams in the normal direction.</p>
