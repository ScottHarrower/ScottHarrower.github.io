That sluggish, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water spots and deterioration.
