<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets should absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet ought to be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most apparent indications of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

Even if the problem stems with the local system, it's still smart to bring in the experts to limit the damage to your home.</p>
