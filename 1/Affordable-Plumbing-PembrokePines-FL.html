<p>Backflow threatens because it can contaminate the general public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and damaging chemicals. In 2010, for example, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky elementary school suffered queasiness and other symptoms after a contractor dealing with the A/C system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>

There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
