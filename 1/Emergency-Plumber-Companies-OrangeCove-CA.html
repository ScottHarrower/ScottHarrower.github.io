<p>To identify which toilet valve is triggering the problem, look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water stains and rust.
