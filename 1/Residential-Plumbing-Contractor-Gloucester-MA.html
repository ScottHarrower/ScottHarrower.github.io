<p>Softeners generally remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often described as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they should be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a big warning that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
<p>Other signs you may need to repipe include rust in your water system, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common indications that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily indicate repiping is the only option. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the problem to figure out the best course of action.</p>
